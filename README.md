# masurium-watut

An add-on for [WATUT](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/watut) (What
Are They Up To), which shows what each player is doing: typing, in a menu, and
**away**. Away is minutes without a key or a mouse button, and a bot has
neither: it walks, digs and fights through code. So WATUT marked a bot AFK while
it worked, with the "zzz" over its head and the tired way of standing that goes
with it.

On a bot's client, and nowhere else, the add-on tells WATUT that the bot is
active whenever it moves, swings or uses something: WATUT's own `onAction()`,
the call its key and mouse hooks make, once a second at most. A bot that stands
still for WATUT's minutes goes away like anyone.

And while its brain thinks an answer to someone, the bot is shown **typing**, the
bubble WATUT draws over a player whose chat is open with text in it: the bridge
tells the body when a turn starts and ends (`/thinking`), and a mixin tells
WATUT meanwhile that the bot's chat is open and that it is typing. Both are
needed: typing in a closed chat shows no bubble. Thinking also counts as
activity, so a bot is not away while it thinks. Nothing in WATUT's jar is
touched, and players see WATUT as always. The mixin is optional, so a WATUT
that changed does not stop the game; the log says once when each part takes
(`[masurium-watut] thinking: ...`).

```bash
./gradlew build                            # build/libs/masurium-watut-<version>.jar
masurium deploy-mod build/libs/masurium-watut-*.jar
```

It compiles against the [Masurium](https://github.com/CharquiPayload/masurium)
core, the release named in `build.gradle`: the first build downloads its jar and
checks it against its checksum. `./gradlew build -Pcore=<a masurium jar>` builds
against another, a core of your own for one.

The jar goes in `shared/mods/`, with the core. It is client side only.

**One exact version.** This add-on is for WATUT **1.21.0-1.2.7**, declared in
its `mods.toml`. WATUT is reached by reflection and a mixin (so building needs
no copy of it: the few names the mixin uses are stubbed in `src/stubs`), and a WATUT that moved `WatutMod.getPlayerStatusManagerClient()`,
its `onAction()`, its `checkIfTyping` or its `sendGuiStatus` would leave the bot away again, or never
typing: with any other version NeoForge
refuses to load the add-on, and a new version of it is due. Without WATUT in
the pack it loads and does nothing.

The core knows about this add-on, as about Veil's: a headless bot whose pack
carries WATUT refuses to start without it (`Bot.ADDON_FOR`), and the launcher's
`doctor` says so before a java is launched.
